Google Analytics Master is the professional plugin to add Google Analytics tracking to your wordpress.


== Description ==

Google Analytics Master allows you to quickly and easily add the Google Analytics tracking code to your wordpress website and display user friendly statistics. There are plenty of plugins that do this but we decided to create a brand new plugin the TechGasp way.

This a free plugin intended for professional websites where clean error free code and fast page load times are a must.

Main tracking features: Accepts the Traditional and the new Google Universal Analytics tracking code. Allows you to insert just the Tracking ID code or the Google full script tracking code (even customized), allows to insert the code in theme header or footer for perfect load times.

Main statistical features: Connects to Google Analytics to pull statistics from all your websites. Packed with 3 easy to use plugin statistical pages, almost no configuration. Quick Statistics Page, Last Week Statistics page, Today's Statistics Page. Also packed with a small administrator dashboard widget to display real-time visitors for any of your websites being monitored by google analytics.
